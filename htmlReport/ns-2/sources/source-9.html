&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * This annotation serves as a general mechanism for providing metadata about a class that serves as
&nbsp; * a &#39;Handler&#39; for another class or classes. &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * This is generally useful for situations where a &lt;em&gt;Handler&lt;/em&gt; class has a method that is only
&nbsp; * valid for certain implementations of a given class, but for which it is not desirable to restrict
&nbsp; * this method to a given type. &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * As an example, take {@link org.springframework.validation.Validator} class and implementations.
&nbsp; * As currently designed, a Validator takes in an open-ended Object to validate:
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;public void validate(Object obj, Errors errors)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * To provide more context around what type of objects may successfully be passed in here for
&nbsp; * validation, a Validator also requires implementation of:
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;public boolean supports(Class c)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * The weakness of this approach is that the classes that this Validator supports are not exposed.
&nbsp; * You must first have a class to Validate and check whether it is supported. It would be preferable
&nbsp; * if each Validator exposed as class metadata the type of Objects that it was capable of
&nbsp; * Validating. Then, via reflection, much more could be determined about the appropriate Validator
&nbsp; * for a given object than is currently possible. This is the problem that this annotation aims to
&nbsp; * solve. &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * The use of this method would therefore be as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; * {@literal @}Handler( supports = { Order.class } )
&nbsp; * public class OrderValidator implements Validator { ... } 
&nbsp; * &lt;/pre&gt;

&nbsp;	 * 100 and the other had an order of 50, the
&nbsp;	 * consuming code could utilize this information to determine which handler is preferred. By
&nbsp;	 * convention, the handler with the lowest order generally gains precedence.
